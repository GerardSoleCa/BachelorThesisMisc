\section{Environmental Impact}\label{S:Environmental-Impact}
At last but not least it is necessary to talk about the environmental impact of the work
described in this document. As can be seen from the present document, this project
consists in the design and development of a software application. This has not a direct
environmental benefit, but IOSharp was an implementation on a high-level basis of .NET Micro Framework which is an operating system for embedded devices, so it makes easy to develop applications which helps control from home installations (i.e. lights, temperature or humidity) to applications capable of detect and analyze different parameters from the environment (i.e. weather stations).
